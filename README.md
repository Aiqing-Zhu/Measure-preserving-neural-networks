# Measure-preserving-neural-networks
This project is to verify the approximation capabilities of measure preserving neural network. The code is based on learner (learner: https://github.com/jpzxshi/learner).

Requirements

    python
    pytorch
    numpy
    matploblib

## Usage

`main.py`: training measure preserving training networks;
`LF_data.py`: generate data;
`LF_output`: plot the trajectories of true and learned systems;
`plot`: plot the illustration of expected error.
